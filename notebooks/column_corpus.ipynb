      "Phones Modern humans today are always on their phone. They are always on their phone more than 5 hours a day no stop. All they do is text back and forward and just have group Chats on social media. They even do it while driving. They are some really bad consequences when stuff happens when it comes to a phone. Some certain areas in the United States ban phones from class rooms just because of it. When people have phones they know about certain apps that they have. Apps like Facebook Twitter Instagram and Snapchat. So like if a friend moves away and you want to be in contact you can still be in contact by posting videos or text messages. People always have different ways how to communicate with a phone. Phones have changed due to our generation. Driving is one of the way how to get around. People always be on their phones while doing it. Which can cause serious Problems. That's why there's a thing that's called no texting while driving. That's a really important thing to remember. Some people still do it because they think It's stupid. No matter what they do they still have to obey it because that's the only way how did he save. Sometimes on the news there is either an accident or a suicide. It might involve someone not looking where they're going or tweet that someone sent. It either injury or death. If a mysterious number says I'm going to kill you and they know where you live but you don't know the person's contact It makes you puzzled and make you start to freak out. Which can end up really badly. Phones are fine to use and it's also the best way to come over help. If you go through a problem and you can't find help you always have a phone there with you. Even though phones are used almost every day as long as you're safe it would come into use if you get into trouble. Make sure you do not be like this phone while you're in the middle of driving. The news always updated when people do something stupid around that involves their phones. The safest way is the best way to stay safe.\n",

      "Phones Driving Drivers should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers who used their phone while operating a vehicle are most likely to get into an accident that could be fatal. According to an article by the Edgar Snyder Firm 21 of teens that were part of a fatal car accident was due to phones. According to the same article 35 know the risk but continue using their phones while on the road. This shows that its beyond dangerous and irresponsible of drivers not to be fully aware of their surroundings while driving. Drivers should be able to concentrate without any distractions because it could be fatal. According to another article Distracted Driving by the NHTSA there has already been about 3000 phone related car accident deaths since 2017. The article states that teen get too distracted with their phones which causes their accident. Accidents that can be easily avoided by focusing on the road and not a phone. Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all while driving. In conclusion drivers should not able to work a vehicle while using their cell phone.

      "Cell Phone Operation While Driving The ability to stay connected to people we know despite distance was originally brought to fruition by the use of letters. This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram the people thought it was an invention of the millennia but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous. Within a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone eyes no longer on the road it is impossible to no an exact location of anything making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law but taken as a more serious offense. Conversely people may believe that laws in present need to change becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices they are an attempt to keep people safe. The creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.\n",

      "People are debating whether if drivers should or should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Some people think that using a cell phone while operating a vehicle should be allowed because they try multitasking and have important calls while some are addicted and can't stay off their phone. Other people says that you shouldn't be able to be on your cell phone while operating a vehicle because the cell phone can cause accidents while driving. I also think that you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle because it can cause vehicle collisions slow reaction time and fatal injuries. Therefore driving can cause many accidents that can be fatal to the driver and passengers if there is any and cell phones should only be used when not operating a vehicle. The first reason why the use of cell phones shouldn't be allowed while operating a vehicle because there are high chances of vehicle collisions happening. Most vehicle collisions happen when the driver is texting or under the influence of alcohol. When people who drives while texting spend more time looking at their phone than the road causing poor carfollowing ability and lateral lane control. While under the influence of alcohol it can cause you to lose concentration and it can also hinder your ability to make rational decisions. As stated before these are some examples of what can cause vehicle collisions. The second reason why you shouldn't operate a cell phone while driving because of slow reaction time. Reaction time is the measure of how quickly an organism can respond to a particular stimulus. When your spending time at your phone and finally look up to see you're about to get into an accident it would already be too late. Reaction times with no activity were between one and two seconds. Reaction times while using a cellphone were at least three to four seconds. On top of that drivers were more likely to miss the flashing light altogether when using a cellphone. Cellphones effects the nervous system when a person is driving. The last reason you shouldn't drive while using a cellphone because it can cause fatal injuries that might have longterm or shortterm affects. The affects can be physical emotional or psychological. One of the most common physical effect is whiplash. Whiplash is caused by a sudden movement of the neck. Whiplash is usually caused by rear end automobile collisions. One emotional effect can be anxiety which can cause difficulties in certain situations involving driving. The last effect is psychological which can cause PTSD. Most car accidents are the results of PTSD but can also be caused by any traumatic experience. PTSD can affect a person's ability to function normally. People who goes through this will sometimes show a wide range of symptoms including anger fear shock nervousness and feeling of mistrust or guilt. In conclusion people shouldn't use cellphones while operating a vehicle. IF they do it can cause life changing accidents and other serious problems in life. Also it can hurt some people financially causing them to pay for these uneventful occurrences. Some things people can do to prevent is to turn their phone off or put it on Do Not Disturb mode to prevent any accidents. They can also deal with that they have to do on the phone before starting the car and driving. One more solution is that they can have the passenger relay a message for you using your phone so you won't be distracted or tempted to pick up the phone.\n",

      "Texting and driving Over half of drivers in today's society have this horrible habit of texting and driving. This has to stop immediately texting and driving puts people's lives at risk. This simple act has caused many fatalities over that last years. Fortunately the government have put a new law to deal with this problem with our generations problem of texting and driving. I strongly feel that texting and driving is dangerous and should be prohibited. Diving more into detail texting and driving is hazardous and life threatening. Just imagine you're on the road driving to your friend's house and someone shoots you a text. You look down not even for 5 seconds then you accidents swerve into the next lane hitting a car. There are so many different scenarios that could go wrong in that situation. Your life is over just because you couldn't wait to text your friend. The consequences that texting and driving comes with just isn't worth it. The cost of a life shouldn't be worth a text message Snapchat or Instagram DM Direct Message. Texting and driving has taken many lives. In a recent article I read it said 2017 U.S. Cell Phone and Driving Statistics. In 2012 3328 people were killed in distractionrelated crashes. About 421000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver. In 2017 11 of drivers under age 20 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. This cannot go on any longer we must do something to stop these numbers from increasing. Luckily the government has enforced a brand new law called Hands Free. This law states Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving. If you don't follow these laws they can fine you fifty to one hundred and fifty dollars. I feel that this action was necessary and justified to better protect our society. Over all texting and driving is dangerous has killed many people and is now on the decline thanks to the new Hands Down law.\n",

Passing away from a motor vehicle accident can be prevented by simply waiting until you have reached a stopping point or your at your destination to pick up your phone. In conclusion drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. It can cause accidents and altercations suspension of license and even death.

      "Phones Driving Essay I believe that drivers shouldn't use cell phones while driving because it is an attention hazzard. Driving with your phone in hand is not only illegal but very dangerous but driving without the distraction of a phone can lower the driving fatality rates by a lot. Also there are apps and programs on the phones that help drivers go hands free. Last having that phone as a distraction while driving can cause a significant lowering of you reaction time and attention to the people objects and other cars on the road. First and foremost Driving without the phone as a distraction will generally lower the fatality rates of distracted driving accidents. Not only will it save you life and everyone else in the vehicle but also you will avoid needless deaths just because you couldn't put the phone down. The lack of selfcontrol is the reason why people get distracted by their phones especially the younger generation of drivers which leads to possibly fatal driving accidents. Furthermore Driving while distracted can significantly slow down your reactions to people objects and other cars on the road with that you would be more likely to hit pot holes and debris on the road and a higher chance of causing an accident. Also looking for pedestrians crossing while distracted just makes driving harder than it has to be. Finally There are various things that have been put in place to keep the driver from getting distracted by their phones For example apps and programs on the phones that keep the driver from checking or responding to their phones. It prevents the driver from getting phone calls texts and other notifications while in the car. Another example the handsfree laws that hold the people that like to drive with phone in hand accountable. Last is personal accountability keeping yourself in check and safe but not just yourself but the people in the car with you and the other cars. In conclusion Drivers shouldn't drive while using a phone because if more people don't drive with their phones the likelihood of them getting into a possibly fatal accident decrease by a lot there are also ways that you phone can keep itself from being a distraction like the apps and programs on it that block phone calls and texts but more importantly the driver personally keeping themselves accountable for their actions on the road and the fact that the more the driver is distracted the slower their reaction time is so they won't be able to pay closer attention to the people objects and other cars on the road.\n",

      "In conclusion Drivers shouldn't drive while using a phone because if more people don't drive with their phones the likelihood of them getting into a possibly fatal accident decrease by a lot there are also ways that you phone can keep itself from being a distraction like the apps and programs on it that block phone calls and texts but more importantly the driver personally keeping themselves accountable for their actions on the road and the fact that the more the driver is distracted the slower their reaction time is so they won't be able to pay closer attention to the people objects and other cars on the road.\n",

      "Although cell phones have been around for quite some time they have become a key part of our lives. We use cell phones for anything now such as texting social media calls schedule planning etc. Unfortunately we are choosing to use them at the wrong time and wrong place while we are driving. As time is going by we are getting more and more into the phones that we don't care about our personal safety or others safety. Using cellphones while driving can be extremely dangerous to the drivers and others around them for many reasons. When we are driving it can be exceedingly difficult to focus on the surroundings around us and easy to forget that you are sharing the road with other people and not just yourself. Other drivers take notice when drivers are on their phones whether they want to or not because of the danger they can cause. Erratic driving is something that we all get worked up about because it can make us late or can be inconvenient to us. Drivers also tailgate you because they can't keep the constant speed because they are on their phones. Sometimes pedestrians are killed because people are on their phones and don't pay attention to their surroundings. We may not intend to end someone's life but we made the poor decision to drive and text so now we must live with that for the rest of our life. Everyday people die in car accidents because we use cell phones while driving. According to my research the number one leading car accidents are distracted drivers. Research shows that being on your phone while driving can cause the risk 4x more of a horrible crash. Because we use cell phones more often now we use our phones knowing the danger it could cause because we want to keep in touch with people. They also think that the handfree is a safe thing to use because they are driving with two hands instead of holding the phone. Driving with cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that they cause it causes someone's insurance to rise and it causes concerns to people's health. I think people are more concerned with their conversation than with their own safety and the safety of others. Research has proven that people who use cell phones while driving are more prone to because an accident. People who use cell phones while driving does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. It also can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that could lead to tragedy. In conclusion people should stop texting and driving because it can cause serious damage. Not only that it can take someone's life. Texting while driving is a serious problem today because we are on our phones 247 and we don't usually put it down. We are distracted by our phones to the point where we shouldn't be able to drive with a phone in the car because of how long we are on our phones. Driving and texting should be banned before we lose more people.\n",

Not texting or being on your phone can save lives if you are driving. I say don't think it is smart to be on your phone while driving because it can cause accidents. There are 1.6 million car crashes a year because people are driving with their phones out. If more people put down their phones then they can know what's going on around them to slow the death rate down. There are 10 percent of teens that die in car crashes because they are on their phones. they are distracted by the internet or people texting them more then there life. If you need a phone for a gps because you don't know where to go then you can use the audio. It will be safer that way because you wont need to keep looking down at your phone or have the passenger help you if you are driving with someone else. Your life means more then a text that can end it all for you or someone else.\n",

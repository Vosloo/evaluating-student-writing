       "\"Texting and driving The use of phones and cars serve many purposes such as communicating with others playing games and using the many different internet based features. We use cars as a means of travel others to modify and race and make them look cool. In every day jobs like firefighters and police use cars to patrol neighborhoods and to travel to the location they are called to. For delivery like packages and food we use cars and phones for most of the things we do in modern society. But get in some accidents or cause accidents with cars and we get hurt because of these accidents physically and financially but they can be avoided taking precautions like insurance and driving safe and keep your car maintenance high or good. According to httpswww. insurancejournal. comnewsnational20180824499107. htm The death toll for 2018 is 18720 and an additional 2.1 million people who have sustained serious injuries due to car accidents in the first six months of 2018. Texting and driving should not be aloud because it can kill people and its bad that it happens. People have lost their lives because of a text which is sad one moment your here next you're not you could be driving one day and text while driving with a blink of an eye you could be gone. The laws and punishment the law should be to not be on your cell phone while driving or if you're are on it make sure it's on speaker phone or have somebody text on your phone to whoever. The punishment should be a fine or community service but no serious punishment because it was an accident. But if it was on purpose then should have jail time why because it was done intentionally and they knew exactly what they were doing. It's a accident most of the time but the point is that it happens which we can't prevent car accidents but we can decrease them. And for coverage for your car like insurance cost sometimes a lot of money it really depends on the insurance company and the benefits from that company. but it's worth it and don't text and drive it may cost you a lot of money or your life it's important to keep your eyes on the road at all times and to pay attention from crashing or getting crashed into. We have highway patrol and police with speeding guns to prevent crashes people cause by speeding or not paying attention. We also have cameras to catch these things that cause accidents and they work most of the time but doesn't reduce accidents. And checkpoints for people who are under the influence and who are intoxicated and who drunk driving. These are some fact to provide evidence that texting and driving is dangerous and has killed people and some things that prevent it.\""

      "People are debating whether if drivers should or should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. Some people think that using a cell phone while operating a vehicle should be allowed because they try multitasking and have important calls while some are addicted and can't stay off their phone. Other people says that you shouldn't be able to be on your cell phone while operating a vehicle because the cell phone can cause accidents while driving.\n",

      "\n",
      "The first reason why the use of cell phones shouldn't be allowed while operating a vehicle because there are high chances of vehicle collisions happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most vehicle collisions happen when the driver is texting or under the influence of alcohol. When people who drives while texting spend more time looking at their phone than the road causing poor carfollowing ability and lateral lane control. While under the influence of alcohol it can cause you to lose concentration and it can also hinder your ability to make rational decisions. As stated before these are some examples of what can cause vehicle collisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second reason why you shouldn't operate a cell phone while driving because of slow reaction time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reaction time is the measure of how quickly an organism can respond to a particular stimulus. When your spending time at your phone and finally look up to see you're about to get into an accident it would already be too late. Reaction times with no activity were between one and two seconds. Reaction times while using a cellphone were at least three to four seconds. On top of that drivers were more likely to miss the flashing light altogether when using a cellphone. Cellphones effects the nervous system when a person is driving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last reason you shouldn't drive while using a cellphone because it can cause fatal injuries that might have longterm or shortterm affects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The affects can be physical emotional or psychological. One of the most common physical effect is whiplash. Whiplash is caused by a sudden movement of the neck. Whiplash is usually caused by rear end automobile collisions. One emotional effect can be anxiety which can cause difficulties in certain situations involving driving. The last effect is psychological which can cause PTSD. Most car accidents are the results of PTSD but can also be caused by any traumatic experience. PTSD can affect a person's ability to function normally. People who goes through this will sometimes show a wide range of symptoms including anger fear shock nervousness and feeling of mistrust or guilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion people shouldn't use cellphones while operating a vehicle. IF they do it can cause life changing accidents and other serious problems in life. Also it can hurt some people financially causing them to pay for these uneventful occurrences. Some things people can do to prevent is to turn their phone off or put it on Do Not Disturb mode to prevent any accidents. They can also deal with that they have to do on the phone before starting the car and driving. One more solution is that they can have the passenger relay a message for you using your phone so you won't be distracted or tempted to pick up the phone.\n",

      "Not only will it save you life and everyone else in the vehicle but also you will avoid needless deaths just because you couldn't put the phone down. The lack of selfcontrol is the reason why people get distracted by their phones especially the younger generation of drivers which leads to possibly fatal driving accidents.\n",

      "Furthermore Driving while distracted can significantly slow down your reactions to people objects and other cars on the road with that you would be more likely to hit pot holes and debris on the road and a higher chance of causing an accident.

Everything from physical pain to emotional pain as well as financial pain can be felt after a crash. 3287 deaths happen every day due to fatal car crashes. On average 9 of these fatalities are related to distracted driving.

It also states that a driver cannot read or watch videos on their phone while driving. Because of this law there have been multiple accessories made that allow drivers to mount their phones in their car so that they can send voice messages or speech to text messages.

      "Utilizing a phone while driving takes many lives every second of our daily lives. About 1.6 million lives a year end up in critical conditions or worse dead. A phone call or text can wait but being impatient can result in deaths. This impatiences creates danger to the person driving and everyone around them. Too many lives are taken by near accidents crashes distractions and running of lights caused by usage of phones by operating moving vehicles. Many more lives could be safer if people chose to wait for their usage of phones after being off the road.\n",

      "\n",
      "Once again using a phone while driving creates too many distractions for the driver and everyone around is left in danger. For example phones can create delays on stop lights which can create simple accidents. The glare of a bright phone on a dark night can actually interfere with the sight of the driver and can cause loss of control or misguidance to swerving. As well as sudden loud sounds from a phone can actually scare or frighten a driver straight to a crash. Occuping phones while driving is one of the biggest reasons for caused crashes all over.\n",

      "My third and final reason for not using phones while driving is because a new law recently has been released on how using phones on the road is no longer permitted anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new law was put in to ensure more safety due to all the distractions caused by phones. Since it is a new law a new law means that it is expected to be followed a new set out rule. It is for the safety of people and everyone surrounding. People will get punished if the new law is not followed and in my opinion i would say that it is one of the greatest laws forced. The new law will minimize the amount of crashes caused by phones on the road all over and save many more lives and everyone around.\n",
      "\n",
      "A phone should not ever be used while a person is driving for any type of situation it can wait. My reasons once again like i said before is that many lives are taken away it is also a big distraction and last would be that it is a new law. A phone is really entertaining and that is something people do not want behind the wheel because then it can become a distraction. Through the whole essay all I could come to head would be about the peoples lives taken away left with a broken down family. Phones ultimately should not be used while driving and a person should not have to double think it before they cause a new tragedy that will leave them with a lifetime of consequences and guilt.\n",

It is just to ensure that we never get bored while also waiting for the next phone with technological superiority to be released. Likewise with driving. It takes up all of our focus to make sure we don't get into a car wreck. In a way driving and being on a cellphone are very similar in regards to how much attention we give it. So when putting both together the ending result are what you would expect it to be catastrophic.\n",

There are plenty of safe ways to use a phone while inside of a vehicle we just choose the most dangerous route.\n",
